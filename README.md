# Paradigm 2021 CTF Foundry
[Paradigm 2021 CTF](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/paradigm-ctf-2021) re-written to be completed using `forge test`.
Solve challenges by writing exploits in [tests](./test).
Some challenges had to be slightly modified to be solvable in unit-tests.

## Ported Challenges
```ml
test
├── BabySandbox.t.sol
├── Bouncer.t.sol
├── Broker.t.sol
└── Market.t.sol
```

Will update the rest as soon as I solve them.
